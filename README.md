## Description

My motivaton was to make a to make a nice looking weather app for myself.
I built his poject in order to get more used to working with web api's.
I learned how to fetch and store data using pull requests.
This app allows you to view the weather forecast of the city you enter.

My code is quite messy because I did not have a lot of free time to focus on cleaning
up this challenge, what with the project and all. It is working fine in my own live server or default browser, but the js does not work in github pages.
